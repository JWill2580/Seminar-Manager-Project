CS&IS Seminars Manager
===============

The Information Science (IS) and Computer Science (CS) departments hold a series of seminars throughout the year. The departments take turns in assigning one staff to give a talk on each Friday. These talks are intended to promote the most recent research advancements of the staff that is willing to give the talk. However, as of now, these seminars are managed using spreadsheets. Your task is to think of a system that can manage the series of seminars in a professional manner.
